# This task will be a huge one, do everything right, with all sttrict rules, we will have hare a lot of javascript, css, html pages, maybe even some execution functionality like passing data from one page to another.


# Things you will need

# Things will help you
## 1. Press F12 key (or simply inspect an element) in order to open developer console on browser
## 2. Open console section
### 2.1 in the console write 
```
alert('Hi there guys!'); 
```
#### afterwards you will see an alert in your browser. Close it.
### 2.1 in the console write 
```
console.log('Hi there guys from logs!'); 
```
#### afterwards you will see a log in log window.
### This will create you a thin feeling of writing some unusefull javascript code
### Javascript is a programing language for generating actions in the web page
### You can write for ex.
```
$('body').hide();
```
#### This will hide page entire content
### Afterwards write
```
$('body').show();
```
#### This will bring content back

### As you maybe noticed it up (or no), code here can be distingushed in 2 groups:
### 1. Finding a selector from a page. In our case it was html tag `body`
### 2. Executing an action on the found tag. In our case action was show()

### Eache javascript line must be finished with ; (semicolumn) element
### The . (dot) element is used to attach (or access a method) form the found element
### You can take web page element by 
```
$('div').show(); //take by tag name, in this case div
...
$('.main-table').addClass('table table-hover'); // add a class to a table with class='main-table'
...
$('#submit-button').hide(); //hide a button, button is selected by id
```

## You can watch several introduction tutorials for jquery framework, to make javascrit a bit easier to understan. It is like css and bootstrap (where css is language, bootstrap is a tool) and in current example javascript is a programing language and jquery is a tool
